# Coding challenge by Webjet 

Hello,

The next step is a small coding exercise we give to all prospective candidates.

This helps us to get a better understanding of your thought process when  you’re developing apps, and thus the requirements have been left open ended.

The exercise instructions are listed on the site.

The need to supply the following token in the header to access the API

x-access-token: sjd1HfkjU83ksdsm3802k

Key points for candidates

	• The solution can be completed in a language of your choice
	• Email the link for the source code once complete, or push it into Git hub..
	• If you are able to host the solution somewhere that would be great, but not required.
	• The test specifically makes mention of the flaky nature of the APIs. You should design a solution 
    to have a functioning app when not all of the services behind the scene are functioning at 100 %.
	• The goal of the test is to allow you to present your best code that you feel proud of.
